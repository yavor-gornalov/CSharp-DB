# C# Databases
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This repository contains solutions to tasks related to problems solved during the study of the 'C# Database' module at SoftUni. The module covers fundamental and advanced topics in database management using Microsoft SQL Server, one of the most widely used database management systems (DBMS) in modern information systems development.

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The course emphasizes the relational model, data modeling with ER diagrams (tables and relational connections), and working with the SQL language (data retrieval, selection, projection, joins, aggregation, grouping, modification, deletion, and insertion). Fundamental knowledge of ACID transactions and transactional processing is provided, along with practical advice for performance tuning. The course lays the foundation for working with databases, making it easier to use them in real applications and understanding concepts such as object-relational mapping (ORM).
